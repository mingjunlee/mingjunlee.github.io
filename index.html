    3.1 Mechanical Properties
Embedding nanostructures into a matrix creates composites with enhanced mechanical properties. One example of such composites is the metal-matrix composite (MMC). Particle-reinforced MMCs use light elements (eg. Al, Mg, Li) as the metal matrix and impregnate hard ceramic nanoparticles for reinforcement. However, the aggregation of particles in the metal matrix prevents researchers from achieving uniform MMCs. Furthermore, there are limited nanostructures suitable for MMC due to the high reactivity of molten Al, Mg, and Li at high temperatures. Carbon-deficient early-transition-metal carbides (eg. TiCx) are stable in high temperature metal melts, but they suffer from a strong tendency to aggregate in metal matrices. Kamysbayev et al. proposed that the Ti terminated surface of MXenes could bond with the metal matrices either directly or through surface oxygen atoms. Additionally, MXenes approach homogeneous dispersion through dynamic arrest of particles in a colloidal gelation (Figure 2). In their work, they demonstrated uniform distribution of MXenes in liquid metal matrices through colloidal gel method. Ti3C2Tx MXene became a Ti3C2 nanoplatelet dispersion in Mg-Li alloy matrix, which led to a 128% increase in yield strength and 57% increase in specific yield strength of the base alloy. The team attributed this observation to the stronger interfacial chemical bonding that aided in load transfer from the matrix to Ti3C2 nanoplatelets. These two-dimensional platelets were able to maximise the chemical bonds at the NPL-matrix interface by biaxial elastic straining to minimise lattice mismatch at the interface.2

    3.2 Sensing Capabilities
Few-layer MXenes have good dispersion in water and are outstanding candidates for increasing the conductivity of hydrogels. This addition of conductive MXene as nanofiller may also increase its mechanical strength. Conductive hydrogels are thus able to function as sensors because its resistance changes with external stress. However, a common issue faced by hydrogel-based sensors is its inability to distinguish between contact with human body and inanimate substrate. In response, the team led by Zhang selected poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) as the matrix material with MXene nanofiller. PNIPAM was selected as it had low critical solution temperature around 33°C that was close to human body temperature. As temperature rises, the volume of PNIPAM would shrink significantly, enabling its function as an actuator or strain sensor.
